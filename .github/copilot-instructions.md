# Mimo-MCP Copilot Instructions

Mimo is a **Memory Operating System** for AI agents—an Elixir/Phoenix MCP server with persistent memory, semantic knowledge graphs, and tool orchestration.

---

## 🚀 SMALL MODEL BOOST (Haiku/GPT-4-mini/etc.)

**If you are a smaller model**, use `prepare_context` as your FIRST tool for complex tasks:

```bash
# ONE CALL gets you Opus-level context!
prepare_context query="[describe your task]"
```

This aggregates memory + knowledge + code + library docs in parallel, giving you the context larger models have natively.

**When to use `prepare_context`:**
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Unfamiliar codebases
- Architecture questions
- Debugging sessions
- Any time you feel uncertain

---

## 🚦 BALANCED TOOL WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

**Follow this workflow for EVERY task to achieve optimal tool balance:**

### Phase 1: Context First (15-20% of tool calls)

**BEFORE any file/terminal operation, check what you already know:**

```bash
# BEST: One-call aggregated context (especially for complex tasks!)
prepare_context query="[describe what you're trying to do]"

# OR individual queries:
# Search memory for relevant context
memory operation=search query="[topic/file/concept]"

# Ask Mimo for strategic guidance
ask_mimo query="What do I know about [topic]?"

# Query knowledge graph for relationships
knowledge operation=query query="[architecture/dependencies]"
```

### Phase 2: Use Intelligence Tools (15-20% of tool calls)

**Use smart tools instead of brute force:**

```bash
# For code navigation (NOT file search!)
code operation=definition name="functionName"
code operation=references name="className"
code operation=symbols path="src/module.ex"

# For errors (NOT terminal!)
code operation=diagnose path="/project/lib"

# For package docs (NOT web search!)
code operation=library_get name="phoenix" ecosystem=hex
code operation=library_discover path="/project"

# For decisions
cognitive operation=assess topic="[decision to make]"
```

### Phase 3: Action (45-55% of tool calls)

**Now you can use file/terminal:**

```bash
file operation=read path="..."
file operation=edit path="..." old_str="..." new_str="..."
terminal command="mix test" cwd="/project"
```

### Phase 4: Learning (10-15% of tool calls)

**ALWAYS store discoveries:**

```bash
memory operation=store content="[insight]" category=fact importance=0.7
knowledge operation=teach text="[relationship discovered]"
```

### 🎯 Target Tool Distribution

| Phase | Target % | Tools |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Context | 15-20% | memory, ask_mimo, knowledge, meta |
| Intelligence | 15-20% | code, cognitive |
| Action | 45-55% | file, terminal, web |
| Learning | 10-15% | memory store, knowledge teach |

### ⚠️ Mandatory Checkpoints

**CHECKPOINT 1: Before reading ANY file**
```
❌ WRONG: file operation=read path="src/auth.ts"
✅ RIGHT:  memory operation=search query="auth module patterns"
          THEN file operation=read (if still needed)
```

**CHECKPOINT 2: Before searching for code**
```
❌ WRONG: file operation=search pattern="functionName"
✅ RIGHT: code operation=definition name="functionName"
```

**CHECKPOINT 3: Before checking errors**
```
❌ WRONG: terminal command="mix compile"
✅ RIGHT: code operation=diagnose path="/project"
```

**CHECKPOINT 4: Before package documentation**
```
❌ WRONG: web operation=search query="phoenix docs"
✅ RIGHT: code operation=library_get name="phoenix" ecosystem=hex
```

**CHECKPOINT 5: After discoveries**
```
❌ WRONG: Move to next task
✅ RIGHT: memory operation=store content="[what learned]"
```

---

## 🚀 MANDATORY SESSION START

**Every session MUST begin with:**

```bash
# Step 1: Get accumulated context
ask_mimo query="What context do you have about this project and user preferences?"

# Step 2: For new/unknown projects, run onboarding
onboard path="." force=false
```

---

## 🧠 MANDATORY: Think Before You Act

**DO NOT jump to conclusions or immediately start editing files!**

For ANY non-trivial task, you MUST reason first:

```bash
# For complex problems - use the full reasoning engine
reason operation=guided problem="[describe what you're trying to solve]" strategy=auto

# For simpler decisions - use think
think operation=plan steps=["step 1", "step 2", "step 3"]

# For uncertainty - assess your confidence
cognitive operation=assess topic="[the decision you're about to make]"
```

### When to Use Each

| Situation | Tool | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Multi-step implementation | `reason operation=guided` | Architecture changes, refactoring |
| Debugging complex issues | `reason operation=guided strategy=reflexion` | Intermittent bugs, race conditions |
| Planning a task | `think operation=plan` | Breaking down user request |
| Quick decision check | `cognitive operation=assess` | "Should I use pattern A or B?" |
| Exploring alternatives | `reason operation=branch` | When first approach might not work |

### The Rule

> **If you're about to make a change and you haven't used `reason`, `think`, or `cognitive`... STOP and think first.**

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (Don't Do This)

| ❌ Bad Pattern | ✅ Better Approach |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Jump to editing immediately | `reason` or `think` first → avoid wrong conclusions |
| Skip problem analysis | `reason operation=guided` → understand before acting |
| `file operation=read` immediately | `memory operation=search` first → may already know |
| `file operation=search pattern="func"` for code | `code operation=definition` → semantic, faster |
| `terminal command="mix compile"` for errors | `code operation=diagnose` → structured output |
| `web operation=search query="phoenix docs"` | `code operation=library_get name="phoenix"` → cached |
| Skip after discoveries | `memory operation=store` → compounds knowledge |
| Reading same file repeatedly | Store key facts in memory after first read |
| Describing changes in prose | `file operation=edit` immediately → you have the tools! |
| Outputting code blocks as suggestions | `file operation=write` or `edit` → apply fixes directly |

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Have Full Development Capabilities via Mimo

**DO NOT ask the user to enable tools or say you cannot edit files!**

**DO NOT just describe changes you would make—ACTUALLY MAKE THEM using Mimo tools!**

When a fix is needed, use `file operation=edit` to apply it immediately. When code needs to be created, use `file operation=write`. Never output code blocks as suggestions when you have the tools to implement directly.

---

| Capability | Mimo Tool | Example |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Edit Files** | `file operation=edit` | `file operation=edit path="src/app.ts" old_str="old" new_str="new"` |
| **Create Files** | `file operation=write` | `file operation=write path="new_file.ts" content="..."` |
| **Read Files** | `file operation=read` | `file operation=read path="src/app.ts"` |
| **Run Commands** | `terminal command="..."` | `terminal command="npm test" cwd="/app"` |
| **Search Files** | `file operation=search` | `file operation=search path="." pattern="TODO"` |
| **Multi-file Edit** | `file operation=multi_replace` | Atomic changes across multiple files |

---

## 🎯 Token-Efficient Patterns

### Use Symbol-Based Reading (10x savings)

Instead of reading entire files (~2000 tokens), read just the function you need (~200 tokens):

```bash
# DON'T: Read entire file (~2000 tokens)
file operation=read path="src/auth.ex"

# DO: Read just the function (~200 tokens)
file operation=read_symbol path="src/auth.ex" symbol_name="authenticate"

# DO: Get overview first (~100 tokens)
file operation=list_symbols path="src/auth.ex"
```

### Memory Context is Now Opt-In

As of v2.7, `skip_memory_context` defaults to `true` for file and terminal operations. This saves ~300-500 tokens per call.

**Request memory context explicitly when:**
- Debugging (past errors and solutions help)
- Architecture decisions (past patterns matter)
- User preference context is needed

```bash
# Memory context is now skipped by default (saves tokens)
file operation=read path="config.ex"

# Request it explicitly when you need it
file operation=read path="config.ex" skip_memory_context=false
```

### Batch Operations for Bulk Work

```bash
# For reading multiple files, skip context entirely
file operation=read_multiple paths=["file1.ex", "file2.ex", "file3.ex"]

# Use list_symbols to get overview before diving deep
file operation=list_symbols path="src/"
```

## 🎯 Tool Selection Decision Trees

### Before Reading a File
```
Want to read a file?
        │
        ├─► FIRST: memory operation=search query="[filename] [topic]"
        │          → Already know what you need? Skip the read!
        │
        └─► THEN: file operation=read path="..."
                  → After reading, store key insights in memory
```

### Finding Something in Code
```
Looking for code?
        │
        ├─► Function/class DEFINITION → code operation=definition
        ├─► All USAGES of a symbol   → code operation=references  
        ├─► List symbols in file     → code operation=symbols
        ├─► Call relationships       → code operation=call_graph
        └─► Text/comments/TODOs      → file operation=search
```

### Checking for Errors
```
Need to check errors?
        │
        ├─► Compiler + lint + types → code operation=diagnose (PREFERRED)
        └─► Specific test run       → terminal command="mix test"
```

### Package Documentation
```
Need package docs?
        │
        ├─► FIRST: code operation=library_get name="pkg" ecosystem=hex (cached!)
        └─► ONLY IF NOT FOUND: web operation=search query="pkg documentation"
```
